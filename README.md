### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently the CTO of [Shopmonkey](https://shopmonkey.io). I've been writing code since I was 12 years old. I started with [Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI_BASIC_(TI_99/4A)) on the [TI-99/4A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-99/4A).  I also used a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) and eventually moved on to a [Apple IIc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIc).  Later in high school, we received a few [TRS-80](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80). I've written software in a variety of languages: Basic, Pascal, Assembly, XBase, C/C++, C#, Java, Objective-C, Ruby, Golang and JavaScript/TypeScript.

I was the original creator of [Titanium Mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium_SDK) and the founder and CEO of [Appcelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appcelerator).  I've been involved in open source for a very long time and worked on a lot of different projects.
